# Abstract:
I want a tool that allows me to test out various equations and the outcomes of different values for each variable within the equation. When I was in high school I created calculator programs to cheat on math tests. The equations would often be known ahead of time, and I would create functions for each one where I only had to enter the values for each variable, and the program would display each step, including the answer for me to copy, one to one. This tool should do the same thing, but allow the user to also define the equation and variable names. This "Equation builder" should break down equations the same as a human would, and display the "answer" at each stage as well as any visuals that might help to illustrate trends.

```
Default:
	Variables
		a = 1
		b = 2
		c = ?

	Equation
		c = (a + b)

	Answer
		c = (1 + 2)
		c = 3
```

In this default view a user might start by changing the variable names and values, followed by the equation itself, to match their problem. They would then have access to how that equation breaks down at each stage of all parenthesis down to the answer for those values. Finally they might then have additional controls to adjust the variable values to then see how those changes affect the answer.
